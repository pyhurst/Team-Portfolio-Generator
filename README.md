## Installation

NPM Inquirer is needed to run the application

## Usage

The user is first asked for his or her's name, email, company id, and company role. Depending on the user's role, they will be asked another question. Either for their office number, Github username, or school depending on his or her's role.  Next, you can add more members to the team (the same information will be asked depending on their role) or else the application will develop the webpage as long as there is a manager on the project.
